# Website

## Requirements

**macOS:** A computer running macOS is needed for this website because the video converter script uses the `avconvert` tool that converts transparent videos into Apple ProRes 4444 temporarily so that they can be converted into transparent videos that are supported on both Safari and Chrome.

**DaVinci Resolve Studio:** The animations are made with DaVinci Resolve Studio, and the Studio version is needed because I leverage DaVinci's Fusion Scripts that automate exporting projects into transparent videos.

- **Python 3.6:** Fusion scripts require Python 3.6 installed on the system.
